title: Keggy Fuzzer
---

Keggy Fuzzer is a fuzzer generator. We make use of the input that Hammer takes, and interpret it in a different way to generate fuzz messages to ensure a good level of assurance for the parser combinator and the grammar defined.

*Build a parser our way, and get a fuzzer for free.*

More information will be added to this page soon.
